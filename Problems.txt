When holding the edge of a group; if the mouse leaves the canvas, the user stops holding the click, then
reenters the canvas, the edge will still follow the users mouse. The user will then have to click again to release it.

If you make a group, add some participants to it, then try to make a second group, your first attempt at clicking the
new group button will result in your original group changing it's outer edge to your mouse location, at the new button.
